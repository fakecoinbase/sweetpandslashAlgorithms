Let's say that you work at a bank that wants to build a model to detect fraud on the platform. The bank wants to implement a text messaging service in addition that will text customers when the model detects a fradulent transaction in order for the customer to approve or deny the transaction with a text response.

1. What kind of model would need to be built?
2. Given the scenario, if you were building the model, which model metrics would you be optimizing for?
