This question was asked by: Facebook
Let's say you're a product data scientist at Facebook. Facebook is rolling out a new feature called "Mentions" which is an app specifically for celebrities on Facebook to connect with their fans.

How would you measure the health of the Mentions app? And if a celebrity starts using Mentions and begins interacting with their fans more, what part of the increase can be attributed to a celebrity using Mentions versus what part is just a celebrity wanting to get more involved in fan engagement?
