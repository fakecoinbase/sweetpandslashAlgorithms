There are two lists, list X and list Y. Both lists contain integers from -1000 to 1000 and are identical to each other except that one integer is removed in list Y that exists in list X.

Write a function that takes in both lists and returns the integer that was removed in O(1) space and O(n) time without using the python set function.
