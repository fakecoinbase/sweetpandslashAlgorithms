Let's say you work for a food delivery company. We have a payment structure for delivery drivers where they make 5% of every order. A product manager wants to launch a new payment structure for delivery drivers where delivery drivers make 2.5% of each order and $50 after each fifth order.  

How would you determine the success of this new structure?
