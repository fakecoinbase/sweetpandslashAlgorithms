We have two buckets full of marbles. There are 30 red marbles and 10 black marbles in Bucket #1 and 20 red and 20 Black marbles in Bucket #2. Your friend secretly pulls a marble from one of the two buckets and shows you that the marble is red.

1. What is the probability that it was pulled from Urn #1?

2. Let's say your friend picks two marbles instead and they both happen to be red. What is the probability that they both came from Bucket #1?
