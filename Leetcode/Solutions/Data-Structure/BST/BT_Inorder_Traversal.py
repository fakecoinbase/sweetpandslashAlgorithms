#Question: Given the root node of a tree, traverse it in order and return it as a list
#Solution: Run a DFS, keep going left if it exists, add node to list, keep going right if it exists
#Difficulty: Easy

#First method, go left and right if children exist
def inOrder(root, order=[]):
    #If the left child of the current node exists, run the function on the left child
    if root.left: inOrder(root.left, order)
    #Add the current node to our list, note this would first happen when we have gone to the leftmost child (ie the smallest)
    order.append(root.val)
    #Run the function on the right child if it exists
    if root.right: inOrder(root.right, order)
    #Return our list
    return order

#Second method, go left and right always, keep a check at the top if root exists
def inOrder2(root, order=[]):
    if not root: return 
    inOrder2(root.left, order)
    order.append(root.val)
    inOrder2(root.right, order)
    return order

#Third method, iteratively traverse using a stack and a pointer
def inorder3(root):
    order, stack = [], []
    #As long as the stack is not empty OR the pointer to the current node is not null
    while stack or root:
        #If the pointer to the current node is non-null
        if root:
            #Append the current (non-null) node to the stack and move left
            stack += [root]
            root = root.left
        #If the pointer to the current node is null, we must have reached the leftmost item in the current stack, so start popping
        else:
            #Save the popped node into a temporary one and add it's value to our order result
            temp = stack.pop()
            order += [temp.val]
            #Move our current pointer to its right child
            root = temp.right
    return order
