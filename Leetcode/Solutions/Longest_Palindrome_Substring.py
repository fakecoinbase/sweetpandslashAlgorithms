#Question: Given a string, find the longest palindrome in it
#Difficulty: Iterate through each element and determine if its a palindrome
#Difficulty: Easy

                l -= 1; r += 1
            #Return s[l+1:r] because the while loop will exit after it is done one extra decrement of l, (ie s[l] != s[r] anymore), and up to r because python list slicing goes up to but not including 
            return s[l + 1: r]
        #For each index in s
